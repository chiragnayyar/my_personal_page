            <p>
                Hola, Iâ€™m Chirag from Northwest India. I am a Techno Commercial guy having a strong startup background who is passionate about working with Cloud Computing. I am hepling Enterprises,SMB and Startups to setup new or migrate their existing application to  <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Cloud</a>.</br>

            <p>
                <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a>
                <br />
                Hands down the best cloud based service I have worked with.
                The reliability of AWS is great and they have all the tools necessary to get your web app up and running.
                With the ability to run Chef in the cloud via OpsWorks and automate your entire infrastructure you
                can't go wrong.</br>

                You know last month I cleared my first AWS exam and become AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Associate.</br>

                For all the AWS folks and who wants to learn AWS from basics to Advance I am creating this place <a href="http://www.awspro.in/" target="_blank"> AWSPRO</a> and I request you to contribute your AWS experience here so everyone can learn easily.

            <p>
                <a href="https://cloud.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Cloud</a>
                <br />
                Google Cloud is the fastest cloud I experience. Their speed and agility to launch new feature is tremendous and I love to play with BigQuery and Google Container Engine. I know its market share is very low than AWS and Microsoft but they are moving fast. </br>

                The first cloud platform which I ever used in my career while I was in my college.I was use to be a Microsoft guy but with the adoption of Linux I am learning it with the pace and playing at Azure Playgroud to create and destroy. Azure Active directory is one of my fav component in Azure.</br>

                 For all the Azure folks and who wants to learn Azure I am creating this place <a href="http://www.azurepro.in/" target="_blank"> AZUREPRO</a> and I request you to contribute your AZURE experience here so everyone can learn easily.

                <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a>
                <br />
                When it comes to productivity and communication there is no question, hands down that Slack
                is the way to go. It has amazing integrations, and a great way to add webhooks to any part
                of your application.
